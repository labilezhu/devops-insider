Log analyser / visualiser for Java HotSpot JIT compiler. Inspect inlining decisions, hot methods, bytecode, and assembly. View results in the JavaFX user interface. 

### Why would I use JITWatch?

-   To verify whether methods you believe to be performance-critical were JIT-compiled during the program's execution.
-   To learn at what point in the execution your performance-critical methods were compiled.
-   To understand the effects of tuning JVM compilation thresholds.
-   To gain a better understanding of the HotSpot JIT compiler.
-   To see how your source code is translated into bytecode and assembly.
